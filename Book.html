         <!--Summary of my favorite book-->
         <p>To be honest I am not too much of a book person. I sometimes find it hard to persevere through the less interesting aspects of a story or tale, so I usually don't bother. With that said, however, I have found some books that I read completely to be very entertaining, and my favorite among these books hsa to be <i>Quarantine</i>. This book starts out as your typical Highschool story, with the new schoolyear starting up. However, this story takes a swift turn away from usual as a virus infects the students on the school, making them extremely toxic to younger children and grown adults. With the school in lockdown, the students inside are forced to improvise their own means of survival, from food and shelter to weapons and other means of defense. What would normally be the common highschool groups of people (Jocks, Nerds, etc.) are now ravenous clans of individuals who only care about their own. The story follows the tales of David, a returning student with some rusty relations with some of the other students, and his little brother, Will, who is a newcomer to the highschool scene that suffers from spontaneous and violent seizures.</p>

         <br>
         <p>Honestly, I really did enjoy this book, as well as the other ones in the series. I found them to tell wild, yet somewhat believable tales that I could imagine myself experiencing, which is a neat feeling that I really enjoy getting out of books. I would honestly recommend this book to anybody who is willing to read a book in general, as it is just plain great.</p>

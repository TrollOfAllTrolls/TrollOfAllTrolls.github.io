         <!--Paragraph about my wonderful family-->
         <p>Overall, I share my household with four amazing family members, which include my mother, my father, my sister, and my dog. All my family members are always there for me, as I have never been let down by them and their tendencies to be outstanding. My mother is a wonderful cook who also has quite a bit of experience in many spectrums of life, such as the field of getting a job. My father is the main work force of the family, as he works a job at Renovate America, which is a house renovation company that my father has greatly contributed to. My sister is among the smartest people that I know on a somewhat personal scale, and she also has a wonderful sense of humor. Her capability to talk about anything without getting into a less than ideal mood is one more of her many astounding traits. Finally, my dog is one of the most adorable beings that I have ever witnessed on this planet. She is a mix between a Maltese and a Yorkshire Terrier, and I suspect her to be part mountain goat, as she is always climbing onto the furniture in our house.</p>

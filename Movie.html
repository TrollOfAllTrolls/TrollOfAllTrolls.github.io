         <!--Review about my favorite move-->
         <p>Over the course of time, I have seen many movies that I would say I have enjoyed. However, if I had to pick one movie that I liked the most, that movie would have to be <i>Edge of Tomorrow</i>. This movie takes place in a universe where part of Europe is invaded by alien forces, which appear to be unkillable. Even though these aliens are labeled as invincible, miltiaries around the world attempt to engage the beings, none-the-less. The main character, Lt Col. Bill Cage, witnesses the horror of these beings in his own skin, as he is thrown into the battle after being assigned to assault one of the beaches that make up part of the invaded territory. However, upon his rather quick death, he notices that he is stuck in a time loop, which resets his perception of time back a day upon his death. Even though he had no prior combat experience, he learns from his mistakes every time he perishes, leading him closer to defeating the alien threat.</p>

         <!--My Review of the movie-->
         <br>
         <p>I honestly really enjoyed this film, as I find the plot and the story to be engaging, interesting, and quite entertaining. The special effects are also done very well, as they give off a very realistic appeal. I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys science fiction, action, or Tom Cruise in general.</p>

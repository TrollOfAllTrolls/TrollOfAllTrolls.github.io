         <p>As of right now, I'm not entirely sure what I would like to do with my future. From where I want to live to who I want to be with, I'm a bit lost in terms of where I would like to be in 10 years (From 2017). However, one thing I do know is that I would like to obtain a job involving the programming and or construction of devices that impact the world. One of the jobs that I am looking into is becoming a Research and Development engineer at DARPA, a defense contractor for the United States. Currently, the average salary for a RnD engineer is around $134,000, so I wouldn't really have to worry too much about my income if I obtain this job. However, getting this gig is a rather demanding task, as they prefer to hire outstanding and educated individuals to get the job done. In order to fit this criteria, I am planning on taking many courses related to both Engineering and Computer Science in highschool, as this world is taking a turn into those fields. After I graduate highschool, I would like to go to a College that can help me gain a more in-depth education in these fields. After that, I then plan on gaining some engineering and programming experience in the real world by getting a lower level job in each field. When I feel like I have enough experience, I will apply for my current, "Dream Job", until I eventullay succeed.</p>
